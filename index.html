  About Ilene Hillary Hinden

  </h1>

  <p>

  I'm an art director + designer, living in North Bergen, NJ. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to level up my career to have more choices of where to work and the kind of work I can do. 

  </p>

  <h2>

  My Mission

  </h2>

  <p>

  As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a web, product and app devloper with a start-up, because I like to work in a creative, challenging, collaborative environment.
